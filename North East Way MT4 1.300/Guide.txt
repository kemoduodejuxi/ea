EA SETUP:
You can run all the pairs from a single chart using the OneChartSetup (only M15 timeframe)
This EA is NOT sensitive to spread, slippage or any other broker related variables.
Use the recommended pairs only.

Input Parameters

OneChartSetup — Launching the adviser at once in several currencies from one chart. Currency pairs must be listed with ",".
For_magic — Prefix for unique magic. Must be between 0 and 99.
Only_One_Symbol? — If true, and there are open positions on the account, the adviser does not open new series of orders in another currency.
For_autolot_use — Which base should be used by the adviser when calculating the lot: equity or balance.
Or_use_fix_balance — Or insert a fixed amount of balance in the currency of your deposit.

Fix_lot_if_AutoMM=0 — fixed lot for the first deal in a series.
